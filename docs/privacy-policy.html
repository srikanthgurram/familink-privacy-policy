    <h3>1.3 Photo Library Access</h3>
    <p>We request access to your photo library to allow you to select existing photos for family member profiles. We only access photos you explicitly select.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
    <ul>

    <p>All data is transmitted using industry-standard encryption (HTTPS/TLS). We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing and Privacy</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not sell, trade, or share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes.</strong></p>
